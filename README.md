My solutions for AoC2022 using Rust.

# Thoughts on Rust
I had poked around with Rust on some small projects just to learn but this was the first time I had tried anything more "substantial". Since I'm posting this over a year after I have finished the AOC puzzles, I can't speak exactly to how I felt about the language at the time but looking over my answers, I'm still really impressed at how succinct Rust can be as a language (and I'm sure even my answers are more verbose than necessary at times!).

# Problem notes
- I never bothered programatically solving Day 23; I found it to be a fun mental puzzle and did it using pencil and paper instead. Maybe I'll come back to this in the future!

# About AoC Solver
Normally I don't use additional libraries when working on AoC and only use things that are native language features but I was linked the AoC helper and thought it was really interesting! I don't think I'll use a helper again in the future but it was nice not having to manually manage the input files :)

# Leaderboard
Using a new language, I don't target hitting the global leaderboard but was close a few times!
